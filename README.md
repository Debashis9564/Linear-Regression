Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, aiming to fit a linear equation to observed data.
Linear regression is widely applied in various fields such as economics, finance, biology, engineering, and social sciences for predictive modeling, forecasting, and understanding the relationship between variables. It provides valuable insights into the strength and direction of the relationship between variables, allowing for predictions and interpretations based on the model's coefficients and statistics.
